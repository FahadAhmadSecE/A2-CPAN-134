layout - I decided I wanted to have text blocks about the company services as I have before, but have a quick run throuogh of what it is and also a shortcut to the interested blocks, so I added cards with images somewhat tying to the service and have them serve as a shortcut to their respective text block

animations - the growth was just for flair, and I added increased scale on the navigation, and the quick summary of the company goal

color pallete - I decided to have color seperators as most companies rather than having blocks of different colors tied to the texts, they have big sections where the entire width of that one area is taken up by a seperate color to subtly show its something else
